## 10.0.0
### Major Changes

- f0aa4e9: Upgrade Table to TanStack Table v9 (`@tanstack/react-table` peer dependency is now `^9.0.0`).
  
  BREAKING CHANGES for Table consumers:
  
  - The `@tanstack/react-table` peer dependency must be upgraded to `^9.0.0`.
  - Column definitions are now typed against the Table's feature set. Replace
    `createColumnHelper<TData>()` with the new `createTableColumnHelper<TData>()`
    export, or pass the new `TableFeatures` type as the first generic of TanStack
    types (`ColumnDef<TableFeatures, TData, TValue>`, `CellContext<TableFeatures,
    TData, TValue>`, etc.). The registered feature set is exported as
    `tableFeatures`.
  - The `columns` prop is now `ColumnDef<TableFeatures, T, any>[]` (mirroring
    TanStack's own columns typing) instead of a per-key mapped type; column
    helper output assigns to it directly.
  - `TableBodyProps`, `TableRowProps`, `TableCellProps`, `TableHeaderCellProps`,
    and `TableHeaderProps` now constrain their generic to TanStack's `RowData`
    (`Record<string, any> | Array<any>`).
  - `RowSelectionState` in v9 is `Record<string, true>`; update any
    `Record<string, boolean>` selection state accordingly.
  - Behavior note: TanStack Table v9 renders function `cell`/`header` renderers
    as React components (v8 called them inline). A column definition recreated
    on each render therefore remounts its cells on each render, resetting any
    internal cell state (open menus, focus). Define columns at module scope or
    memoize them with stable dependencies.

### Minor Changes

- f0aa4e9: Table's manual row ordering (Move Up / Move Down) is now implemented as a
  TanStack Table custom feature. New `rowOrderingFeature` export (with
  `RowOrderingState`, `RowOrderingTableState`, `RowOrderingTableOptions`,
  `RowOrderingTableApis`, and `RowOrderingRowApis` types) registers a
  `rowOrdering` state slice, an identity-stable `table.setRowOrdering` state
  setter, and `row.moveUp()` / `row.moveDown()` row APIs.
  
  Fixes: an open row kebab menu no longer closes when the `data` prop updates
  mid-interaction (the move callbacks previously lived in component state, and
  their churn remounted the kebab cells on every data change).
  
  Fixes: moves now interact correctly with pinned rows. Pinned rows render in
  their own region, so moving relative to one had no visible effect; moves now
  skip pinned neighbors, and the new `row.getCanMoveUp()` / `row.getCanMoveDown()`
  APIs (which drive the kebab menu's disabled states) report whether an unpinned
  row exists to move past.
- f0aa4e9: Table now reflects `data` prop changes without a remount (e.g. polling or
  refetching). Previously the data array was copied into internal state on first
  render, so updates were ignored unless consumers forced a remount with a `key`.
  Manual row reordering (Move Up / Move Down) is preserved across data updates;
  rows added after a manual reorder append at the end. The `key` remount pattern
  still works but is no longer necessary.

### Patch Changes

- 4ff8007: Fixes an issue in the Gantt component where ref-based callbacks would prevent subscriptions from firing whenever callback dependencies changed. This addresses observed layout/display bugs when modifying props.

## 9.13.0

- b6b1064: changes SelectField component to be consistent height with other inputs

## 9.11.3
### Patch Changes

- a76da93: Fix `CoordinateField` in controlled mode wiping all segments during edits. Emptying one segment (or entering an invalid coordinate) emits `onChange(null)`; when the parent echoed that `null` back into the `value` prop, the field re-synced from it and cleared every segment and any just-set validation error. The field now recognizes echoes of its own `onChange` emissions and leaves in-progress edits and validation errors intact.
- 7dd620f: Fix four `NoticeList` bugs:
  
  - "Clear All" no longer throws (`queue.clear` was passed unbound, so `this` was `undefined` and clicking the button raised a TypeError without clearing anything).
  - Per-notice `timeout` and `color` now take precedence over the list-level `defaultTimeout`/`defaultColor`, matching the documented behavior ("defaults for notices without explicit timeout/color"). Previously the list-level values silently overrode every notice.
  - A `NoticeList` without an `id` no longer consumes notices that were explicitly targeted at another list, which previously caused targeted notices to render twice (once in the targeted list and once in every untargeted list).
  - The internal queue subscription is now registered once with proper cleanup. Previously a new subscription was added on every render and never removed, leaking listeners for the life of the page.
- 4b85982: Fix four `Sidenav` visual bugs:
  
  - `Sidenav` headings (`SidenavMenu` titles, the closed-state popover title, `SidenavAvatar` headings, and `SidenavContent` section headings) no longer render forced uppercase — heading content now renders verbatim.
  - The `SidenavLink` external-link arrow (and the `SidenavHeader` collapse chevron) now hide reliably when the sidenav is collapsed. The `__transient` collapsed-state hide previously tied on specificity with `Icon`'s own `display`, leaking icons into the collapsed rail; it is now forced so it applies uniformly to text and icon children.
  - The expanded `SidenavMenu` trigger title now uses `body-s` (12px), matching its own collapsed-state popover title and sibling nav items, instead of the smaller `body-xs` (10px) section-label size it previously inherited.
  - The collapsed rail now honors `--sidenav-width` in push layouts (`DrawerLayout push`), matching overlay mode. Previously `--sidenav-width` only affected overlay mode (via the collapse transform) and push-mode rails were content-driven, so the collapsed width was inconsistent between the two layouts and not themeable in push mode.
- Updated dependencies [a76da93]
  - @accelint/geo@0.6.1

## 9.11.2
### Patch Changes

- e2dce9f: Fix checkbox and switch scroll-into-view behavior. Prevents browser from automatically scrolling when clicking checkboxes or switches by overriding focus() to use preventScroll option.

## 9.11.1

### Patch Changes

- bf5c161: Fix Drawer push layout: closed drawers no longer permanently reserve layout space. Each drawer's grid track collapses when closed and expands only when open, so content is pushed aside only while a drawer is open.
- 27295c8: Fixed layout issue with drawer
- ce8f3b2: Fix ComboBoxField clear button: clicking where the hidden clear button sits now focuses the input and opens the dropdown instead of doing nothing.
- 0e8dbfc: Fixed MGRS coordinates input behavior. Also, enhanced some of the UX with the function

## 9.10.0
### Minor Changes

- 690fb19: Gantt component implementation feature branch. Makes component available to library consumers.
- 7042d56: Add semantic cascade selection mode to Tree component. When enabled via `selectionCascade` prop on `useTreeState`, selecting a parent node automatically selects all descendants, and parent checkboxes show indeterminate state when partially selected. Includes performance optimizations for large trees and automatic cascade state synchronization after drag-and-drop operations.
- 62c5a63: - Adds new design system animation tokens for duration and easing for consistent animation effects
  - Adds light built-in animation to the following components: Accordion, Button, ComboboxField, Dialog, Drawer, Menu, Notice, Popover, Sidenav, Switch, Tooltip
  - Guidelines and best practices documentation for using animation
- 166bc49: Add floating card pinning feature and new placement props.
  
  - Cards can be pinned to disable dragging via a `'pin'` header action
  - `togglePinCard` and `isPinned` added to the floating card context
  - New `FloatingCardHeaderAction` type supports `'pin'` alongside existing `'divider'` and custom button actions
  - `FloatingCardProvider` accepts `initialPinned` to pre-pin cards at mount time
  - `FloatingCard` accepts `initialPosition` (`{ x, y }`) to set the starting coordinates of the panel
  - `FloatingCard` accepts `initialDimensions` (`{ width, height }`) to set the starting size of the panel (defaults to `300 × 400`)
- 118174a: Adds the Carousel component. Displays a timeline of navigatable items for display in one central viewing area.

- Updated dependencies [ed09ea6]
  - @accelint/logger@1.0.0

## 9.6.0
### Minor Changes

- d8a0168: Add video player component implemented using media-chrome

### Patch Changes

- 18f8fdc: BREAKING CHANGE: Restructured tokens and utilities to better utilize Tailwind patterns
  
  The vast majority of changes are non-breaking: All of the same utility classes for color, typography and spacing exist and should work without change
  
  However, in order to support the simplification of utilities, the structure of typography tokens had to be inverted. This means that if you were directly referencing a typography CSS var or TS token, the name / pathing has changed. Examples of how to migrate:
  
  `--typography-header-xxl-size` -> `--typography-size-header-xxl`
  `tokens.typography.header.xxl.size` -> `tokens.typography.size.header.xxl`
  
  Additionally, all `classification` and `roe` colors have been structured under the `domain` key
  
  Finally, the `w-content` utility was removed in favor of the existing `w-fit` class from Tailwind
  
  NEW FEATURES: The color and spacing utilities have become more flexible
  
  The color utilities `bg`, `fg`, `icon` & `outline` now support more colors as well as alpha overrides.
  
  - `bg-` can now access `bg-*`, `domain-*`, `primitive-*` colors
  - `fg-` can now access `fg-*`, `domain-*`, `primitive-*` colors
  - `icon-` can now access `fg-*`, `domain-*`, `primitive-*` colors
  - `outline-` can now access `outline-*`, `domain-*`, `primitive-*` colors
  
  And all of these utilities support the Tailwind alpha override pattern, which makes `bg-surface-default/50` possible
  
  The spacing utilities are now able to implement values outside of the labeled scale of `xxs` -> `oversized`. If needed, it is now possible to use `p-10` which would implement padding of `10px`
  
  CAVEAT!
  
  While we strive to enable easier use of our design system, we expect that the use of non-semantic color values and spacing values outside of the labeled scale should only be used during rapid prototyping / experimentation or in extreme edge cases where a style has gone beyond the prescribed design system approach
  
  Please continue to use the semantic tokens and labeled spacing tokens for the overwhelming majority of implementation to avoid stylistic drift
- 50752b2: fixed a style bug where the table header kebab would disappear while open when persistHeaderKebabMenu: false
- Updated dependencies [4fc6b36]
- Updated dependencies [18f8fdc]
- Updated dependencies [58bc0db]
  - @accelint/design-foundation@3.0.0
  - @accelint/geo@0.6.0

## 9.5.0
### Minor Changes

- 77b277d: Add audio and media controls components implemented using media-chrome
- 2101f3b: Added new component - <StatusIndicator />
- b07b967: Added clear button functionality to ComboBoxField component. The clear button appears when the input has a value and allows users to quickly clear the input.
  
  New props:
  - `isClearable` (boolean, default: true) - Controls whether the clear button is shown
  
  The clear button can be triggered by clicking the button or pressing Escape when the input is focused and not empty. The button is automatically hidden in read-only mode and respects the disabled state.
  
  Additionally, the Input component has been optimized to use a shared internal ClearButton component, reducing style overhead.

### Patch Changes

## 8.0.0
### Major Changes

- f3a9fb3: This release contains a number of breaking changes and will require some migration steps. For detailed information about why the changes were made and how to migrate, [consult our v8 migration guide](https://design-toolkit.accelint.io/?path=/docs/upgrade-guides--playground).
  
  Breaking Changes:
  * Removed support for Tailwind Variants in Design Foundation - functions `tv`, `mergeVariants` and `twMerge` are no longer exported
  * Badge & Chip prop `variant` is renamed to `color` to align with Button
  * Popover structure updated – PopoverTrigger is now the root; triggerable elements and popover content must be direct children.
  * `sudo:` custom variant utility removed.
  
  Improvements:
  * Introducing CSS modules as another tool for working with Tailwind
  * Components now use 1–3 core classes instead of large utility sets.
  * State-based styles are applied only when active, reducing DOM noise.
  * Variant syntax updated: use @variant blocks with @apply instead of chained selectors.
  * CSS layer system expanded: `components.l1–l5` for controlled style precedence; use higher layers (l3–l5) or @utilities for overrides.
  * Improved CSS validation – invalid class names now throw errors during compilation.
  * Eliminated CPU-intensive TV/tw-merge resolution; runtime performance improved at scale.
  
  New Features:
  * Added additional custom variants: extend-left/right/top/bottom, push-left/right/top/bottom.
  * Action Bar: added size prop for flexible usage.
  
  Migration Guide:
  * [Visit the v8 migration guide](https://design-toolkit.accelint.io/?path=/docs/upgrade-guides--playground) for detailed information about migration
  * CSS Modules are required – Next.js supports out-of-the-box; other frameworks may need setup.
  * Named group classes (group/*) must not be hashed – use provided generateScopedClassName (Vite) or getLocalIdent (Webpack/Next.js).
  * Use `clsx` exported from the DTK for conditional class composition rather than `tv` at the path `@accelint/design-foundation/lib/utils`
  * When using css modules in your application, avoid composes – external composes bypass Tailwind processing
- 80db585: BREAKING CHANGES:
  Design Toolkit no longer exports `tv`, this is now available from Design Foundation
  
  Created new package @accelint/design-foundation that houses all of the Tailwind tokens, variants, base styles and utilities for easier reuse without having a dependency on the larger Design Toolkit
  
  Updated Map Toolkit Storybook and NextJS demo app styles to import the new Design Foundation

### Minor Changes

- 3f9d14b: Added a Kanban component with a drag-and-drop board for organizing tasks and workflows.
- 3d6a25b: Add prefix and suffix to (text) Input and TextField components.
- e463867: New feature added: Pagination. A lightweight implementation to allow users to navigate pages, with previous and next links.
- b48a3bd: Add CoordinateField component with support for multiple coordinate systems (DD, DDM, DMS, MGRS, UTM).

### Patch Changes

- a5dfc06: Update all fields component to have the correct width
- 874edd5: ## Breaking Change: Structured Clone Constraint
  
  The event bus payload is now constrained to values that are serializable by the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm). This constraint aligns the TypeScript types with the actual runtime behavior of the `BroadcastChannel` API.
  
  ### What this means
  
  You can no longer pass the following types in event payloads:
  
  - Functions
  - Symbols
  - DOM nodes
  - Prototype chains (class instances lose their methods)
  - Properties with `undefined` values (they're omitted)
  
  ### How to migrate
  
  **❌ Before:**
  
  ```typescript
  bus.emit('user-action', {
    callback: () => console.log('done'), // ❌ Function
    userData: userClass, // ❌ Class instance with methods
    element: document.getElementById('foo'), // ❌ DOM node
  });
  ```
  
  **✅ After:**
  
  ```typescript
  // Option 1: Send only data, handle logic separately
  bus.emit('user-action', {
    actionType: 'complete', // ✅ Primitive
    userData: { id: userClass.id, name: userClass.name }, // ✅ Plain object
    elementId: 'foo', // ✅ Reference by ID
  });
  
  // Option 2: Use event types to trigger behavior
  bus.on('user-action-complete', () => {
    console.log('done'); // Handle callback logic in listener
  });
  ```
  
  ### Supported types
  
  - Primitives (string, number, boolean, null, BigInt)
  - Plain objects and arrays
  - Date, RegExp, Map, Set
  - Typed arrays (Uint8Array, etc.)
  - ArrayBuffer, Blob, File
  
  ### Finding issues
  
  TypeScript will now catch most violations at compile time. Runtime errors from `BroadcastChannel.postMessage()` indicate non-serializable values that slipped through.
- 2470426: Updates the styling of the last child in breadcrumb to match designs
- 4ca8fe5: fixes semantic token discrepancy
  
  plus updates state styles of switch, text-area-field, checkbox, option-item and menu-item
- 67edb84: Fixes an issue where the MenuTrigger and DrawerTrigger components were not being properly exported.
- abc5365: Fix issue where the timer does not start unless hovered for notices.

- 0093e60: Fix issue with use client directive prepend logic not working during build

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- 3d71b8d: Refactored the DesignToolkit so that it does not use the dot syntax anymore. As an example, `Drawer.Header` is now `DrawerHeader` and so on. This change is required to avoid RSC throwing `undefined` errors in some cases when rendering.

  This is a breaking change and will require removing the dot notation from components currently in use in your code base.

  This change also updates the import/export paths for the components. If you are not importing from the root `@accelint/design-toolkit` path, then you will need to update your imports as follows:
  - `RootComponent` goes from `@accelint/design-toolkit/root-component` to `@accelint/design-toolkit/components/root-component/index`
  - `RootComponentHeader` goes from `@accelint/design-toolkit/root-component` to `@accelint/design-toolkit/components/root-component/header`

### Minor Changes

## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

- 6d131cd: A refactor introducing breaking changes for the Tooltip component. The structure is now a light wrapper around the [Tooltip](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Tooltip.html) implementation. Tooltip has been replaced with Tooltip.Trigger and Tooltip.Body has been replaced with Tooltip. Reference the [docs](https://gohypergiant.github.io/standard-toolkit/?path=/docs/components-tooltip--playground) for implementation instructions.
- ac5378e: Changed to new naming system for fontsource.

  Breaking change: This will require changing packages downstream according to the [v5 migration blog](https://fontsource.org/docs/getting-started/migrate-v5) on fontsource.

  Example:

  From this:

  ```json
      "@fontsource/roboto-flex": "^5.2.8",
      "@fontsource/roboto-mono": "^5.2.8",
  ```

  To:

  ```json
      "@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex": "^5.2.8",
      "@fontsource-variable/roboto-mono": "^5.2.8",
  ```

### Minor Changes

The implementation includes an individual Notice component for single notifications and Notice.List for queue-based notifications. The system supports five color variants (info, advisory, normal, critical, and serious) with customizable action buttons, automatic timeout management, flexible dequeuing options, and portal-based rendering. View the [Notice component in Storybook](https://gohypergiant.github.io/standard-toolkit/?path=/docs/components-notice--playground) for interactive examples and documentation.
